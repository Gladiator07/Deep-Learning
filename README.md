# ALL ABOUT DEEP LEARNING

### This repository contains all the resources which I have used to learn Deep Learning. Resources may be blogs, articles, university lectures, handwritten notes and code notebooks.

### Complete resources are in accordance with [this](https://whimsical.com/deep-learning-ATLrXg4dkRLi1ZgyEWnH67@VsSo8s35WwAc3CHNajGTpc) mindmap

#### Note: This repo will be updated daily as I learn

## How to learn from this repo?
- First access the mindmap [here](https://whimsical.com/deep-learning-ATLrXg4dkRLi1ZgyEWnH67@VsSo8s35WwAc3CHNajGTpc).
- The mindmap is divided into theoritical and practical stuffs.
- Start learning in order (mindmap have clickable links which will be redirected to this repo corresponding to the topic).
- For topics having no links associated with it in the mindmap, be patient it will be updated or you can even open an issue.
- Important Papers with their implementation will be added shortly.

## Some tidbits
- Don't get overwhelmed by number of topics. Just start one topic and complete it step by step.
- Code, code, code.
- Don't ignore theory.
- Complete [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) to get basic understanding of all major fields in Deep Learning. Then after that you can go more in depth from this repository.
