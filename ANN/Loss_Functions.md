# LOSS FUNCTIONS

Keras great documentation on all types of loss function can be found [here](https://keras.io/api/losses/)

### Below links explain more about the loss function I found difficult to understand

#### Categorical cross entropy vs Sparse Categorical cross entropy
- [Keras docs (Probabilistic losses)](https://keras.io/api/losses/probabilistic_losses/#sparse_categorical_crossentropy-function)
- [Cross entropy loss functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-entropy-loss-function-f38c4ec8643e) - article
